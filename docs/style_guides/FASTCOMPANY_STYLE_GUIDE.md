> "Every December, the same ritual plays out in companies everywhere..."

### Universal Truth
Start with broadly applicable statement:
> "Every relationship in your life will be built on one pivotal thing: trust."

> "When you're the one in charge, asking for help can be one of the most difficult—but also most important—components of your role."

### Direct Problem
State the problem immediately:
> "This end-of-year push may feel productive, but here's the thing: relying on it as your primary moment for reflection and planning can be a grave mistake."
