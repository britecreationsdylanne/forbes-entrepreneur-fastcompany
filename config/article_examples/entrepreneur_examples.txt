HEADLINE: The Government Is Taking Up Too Much of Our Focus. Here's Why

Key Takeaways
Chasing every policy headline turns leadership reactive and distracts from long-term business growth.
Treat regulation as a known constraint, not a constant alarm demanding immediate strategic change.

For many business leaders and CEOs, keeping up with government policy has started to feel like a full-time job. Every day, there seems to be new regulations, shifting trade rules, changing tariffs and inflation updates dominating news headlines.

It can feel like the American marketplace is in a constant state of flux, which can lead to anxiety and a sense of unsettledness. The result of paying too much attention to the news cycle is that it can quietly pull focus away from the work that's needed to grow your company.

Government volatility is definitely a real factor. Policy changes matter, especially in regulated industries. But when you spend too much time reacting to every update, the risk is that you're letting policy shape your business more than your own vision.

Constant reaction leads to inconsistent results

Policy and regulation are always a moving target; it's been the dynamic since the dawn of this country. Regularly, there are new proposals and new rules introduced at the state and federal level. We also live in an information economy where these updates are widely broadcast. This combination can create an environment where business leaders react to everything. Not only reading every headline, but attending every webinar and rethinking strategy with each shift.

But this kind of overreaction is dangerous. When you respond too heavily to constant policy changes, your decision-making process becomes reactive instead of intentional. Worse yet, your focus can get cloudy as you lose sight of your long-term vision because you're occupied with adjusting to short-term fluctuations.

Many government-related changes are temporary in nature, and they evolve or reverse altogether. So, reacting too quickly can lock you into decisions that won't make sense months later.

This doesn't mean regulation should be ignored. In many business sectors, compliance is a non-negotiable. Rules matter, and violating them can be costly. My industry, insurance, is one of the most heavily regulated, so this has become a real balance we've had to contend with. But as I've found, there's a difference between being informed and being consumed by updates.

Know your place and act accordingly

The goal isn't to bypass regulation or push boundaries in ways that could be risky to your business. Companies that try to overstep or ignore the rules often pay for it later. The smarter approach, however, is to find a way to work within the regulatory framework.

You'll want to stay informed for the benefit of your company, but also try not to be alarmist. Once you understand the rules and can build systems to comply with them, regulation stops being a constant distraction. It becomes a known constraint, and known constraints are much easier to manage than unknown ones.

Understanding regulation can give you a leg up on competition

Navigating regulation isn't easy. There's lots of jargon and legalese and a rotating door of changes. It's one of the hardest parts of operating in industries like insurance, finance or health.

But here's a secret: companies that figure it out can gain a powerful advantage.

Understanding how to operate within a regulatory system creates barriers to entry. Not everyone can, or will, do the work required to comply properly. When a company learns how to work through regulation rather than around it, that knowledge becomes a lifeline. In this sense, regulation can become a superpower. It forces discipline and rewards organizations that invest in compliance.

Companies that understand the regulatory environment can help their partners and clients navigate it, too. Share your insights in newsletters or one-on-one conversations, doing so will build trust and strengthen relationships, especially in these uncertain times.

Delegate compliance to someone you trust

One reason government volatility eats up so much time is that leaders often try to personally track everything, which is inefficient and unnecessary.

Instead, you need someone responsible for compliance who is deeply plugged into regulatory bodies, state bulletins, federal updates and industry guidance. This person can interpret what's relevant and flag what actually requires action. Because not every policy shift has the same impact on every company, inflation, tariffs, and trade rules can dramatically affect some businesses while barely touching others. The person in charge of compliance can know what is relevant for your company.

Trusting them to do their job can also take you out of the process to focus on other agenda items that need your attention. Rather than try to endlessly sift through the noise, you just need to know about the topline of what matters and when. Then, and only then, you can find an appropriate reaction and get back to business as usual.

HEADLINE: Annual Reviews Are Lazy. Here's How to Actually Learn From Your Work

Key Takeaways
Post-mortems should happen after every major project, meeting, or incident, not just annually.
Create a safe, no-blame environment with clear roles, checklists and documented feedback.
Pre-mortems help anticipate challenges, improving planning, communication and future project outcomes.

It's that time of year again, time for the holiday parties, the client gifts and the annual post-mortems where we analyze what went well over the course of 12 months, what failed, and what we can take into the new year. Every time this comes around again on the calendar, I always have one question: Why do we do this just once a year?

Annual traditions should be left to Christmas, Hanukkah and birthdays, not one of the most important parts of assessing your business and its strengths and weaknesses. While an annual recap is a necessity, I'd also go as far as to say that any time a big project wraps up, you should be doing a post-mortem. Any time an important meeting with stakeholders is held, you should do a post-mortem. Pitches and partnerships are also key times to be debriefing and putting together your formal thoughts.

There should also be consideration to incident post-mortems, where there's a proper evaluation after something goes awry. Really, this formality should be a best practice for any occasion when considerable time and resources are involved.

What a good post-mortem looks like

At the heart of a post-mortem is the communal meeting where key parties come together to discuss the year, the project or the incident. During the meeting, it's important to present a collaborative, "no-blame" atmosphere where participants know it's a safe place to give their honest feedback and opinions, and take ownership if needed, without any fear of punitive action or retribution.

Having a checklist and a note-taker is essential. This ensures you have a record of all feedback. You can return to the document later if needed. Key areas to discuss include: the original goals of the year or project, what was accomplished, and what could have gone better. Review the methods that worked well and those that didn't. Identify key problem areas and any technical or technological difficulties. Consider tools that could have improved the project. Discuss the financial impact and takeaways for the future. Finally, outline any new responsibilities that result from this discussion.

Ideally, for post-mortems that are outside the annual window, you should hold this session within a week of a project wrapping while everyone's takeaways are still fresh. It's also a good idea to send a survey or checklist to participants (and even employees who may not be in the meeting). This provides a wealth of responses upfront that will help you create a proper meeting agenda. Share this with all attending so they know what will be discussed and can give extra thought to the specific items ahead of time. An agenda will also keep the meeting on track.

You'll want to designate a moderator, a note taker and the person who will be writing the actual post-mortem report. I'd recommend rotating different personnel to fill these roles for each post-mortem, so it's not always the same person and there's a fresh approach to these key responsibilities.

When the report is finalized, it's a good idea to share it company-wide so that everyone feels equitable and in-the-know of company developments. After all, an effective post-mortem can lead to improved morale, more streamlined processes and also boost communication.

Consider pre-mortems, too

While reviewing a business year or an important project after the fact is essential, there's also a case for using this framework in the planning stages, too. This is where the pre-mortem comes in. The same questions and checklists can be utilized, but thought of through a preliminary perspective.

So, what might the challenges be that could come up? What are some tools that might help tackle the job more effectively? What may be the financial impact, etc? Giving analytical thought to a project before it kicks off can actually prevent some of the shortfalls that would otherwise end up in a post-mortem. It also gives license to stakeholders and employees to air any worries or concerns they have ahead of time, further mitigating a bad result.

In the end, the goal is always about having the best learning opportunities and opening up the lines of communication so all of that knowledge can be applied in the future, whether it's next week or next year.

HEADLINE: 58% of College Grads Are Still Job Hunting. Here's How to Attract and Retain Young Job Seekers

Key Takeaways
Gen Z values flexibility, purpose and genuine workplace connection.
Outdated hierarchies push young workers away faster than pay gaps.

The US job market has reached a new level in 2025. According to Fortune, more than half of new college graduates (58%) are still looking for a job. That's more than double the 25% of Millennials, Gen Xers and Baby Boomers looking for work right out of college in previous decades.

But here's the good news: There's a whole crop of fresh talent to hire for your open positions. You just have to know how to attract them, tap into their reservoir of knowledge and keep them for the long term.

Young minds bring fresh ideas

Gen Z can often get an askew reputation in the minds of some employers who think they are "lazy" or "unprofessional" because they don't always want to work in the office five days a week or have a different idea of what work-life balance should be. (Did we forget this generation grew up doing years of remote or hybrid schooling?) But that old-fashioned thinking is a huge disadvantage for companies that don't consider what these young minds and tech-savvy workers bring to the table.

While many of us have stayed committed to our diehard habits (like emails and paper trails), young workers are at the forefront of advancements and present us with much we can learn from them. However, this dynamic is a two-way street, and employers must also be ready to present Gen Z with a work environment that excites, motivates and values them.

Finding the right culture fit

A large part of this balance really comes down to work culture. So many businesses still adhere to an antiquated model where the employer is always the boss, no matter what, and employees are seen as there to serve and cater to them.

That not only comes across as inequitable but also is a fast track to burnout. When people wonder why so many young workers are job-hopping, this misaligned ecosystem is one of the biggest culprits. On the other hand, the companies performing well have adopted a value-driven work culture with great employee incentives and flexible work structures, and where people like going to work.

When I started BriteCo in 2019, I thought a lot about what our company culture should be. At the time, there were so many conversations around what Silicon Valley was doing. All these tech companies thought the way to attract young people was with ping pong tables. A rec room wasn't exactly what I had in mind, though having fun and enjoying team camaraderie was, and we achieve that in several ways.

Our company offers and encourages programs like Brite Shadow (to tag along with an employee in a different department) and Brite Room Spark Sessions, where someone can lead a topic for a lunch or happy hour session, whether it's learning more about the diamond industry or how to make summer cocktails.

We also have an in-office book club and host regular All Hands functions where everyone, new hires to senior leaders, work together to assemble entertaining presentations. We also offer hybrid work environments and unlimited time off policies that meet young workers where their own needs and desires are for a modern workplace.

The job boards of the future

Finding a young workforce also requires meeting Gen Z where they are job searching, properly reviewing resumes, and setting up as many interviews as needed to find the right fit. According to the World Economic Forum, more than 90% of companies are now using AI to filter and rank job applications, which may cut down on the legwork, but there are issues with these automations.

"AI systems still largely rely on self-reported candidate information, making them susceptible to inaccuracies," says the WEF article. "What's more, these systems can also filter out highly qualified, high-skill candidates if their profiles don't match the exact criteria specified in the job description." If you want to find the best candidates that will be well-matched to the company and stick around, it will take more investment than relying on a third party.

First, it's best to post openings on job boards that young people like to use, such as LinkedIn, social media, and Handshake (a platform used by many colleges and universities). We also work with many of the higher education schools in our backyard to build a natural pipeline to talent.

I'm happy to report that an overwhelming majority of our team is Gen Z and most have stayed with us for several years, first coming on board as interns and accepting positions when the term was over. This is one of the best options for hiring young talent because both parties get to "test it out."

They get firsthand experience that lets them evaluate the position and the company, and you've already invested time in training and getting to know their capabilities and strengths. At BriteCo, we also move beyond the remedial intern tasks like fetching coffee or printing out reports, instead offering real, tactical work responsibilities like researching, working with customers, and creating content.

And what we've found is that when everybody has some level of ownership over what they do, it's powerful. They feel like an important part of the company that wants to grow right along with us.

HEADLINE: Why Work-Life Balance is a Myth That's Making Entrepreneurs Miserable

Key Takeaways
Work-life balance is a myth; focus instead on intentional work-life integration.
Enjoying meaningful work removes rigid boundaries and makes both work and life rewarding.
Align business goals with personal growth to energize every area of your life.

We've seen all the think pieces about work-life balance. We've heard plenty of opinions from burned-out employees and concerned health experts, and even seen travel blogs touting countries like New Zealand and South Africa to find the perfect utopia where 'work to live, not live to work' exists.

But what if none of it is real? What if everything we've been led to believe about work-life balance is just a myth, and thinking we are failing in the mission leaves entrepreneurs miserable and unfulfilled?

I remember feeling this way when I first started my company, BriteCo. I was plagued with the thought that I was not giving enough hours to my business or that I was not committed enough as a father and husband when I was at home, if I spent too many hours at the office. The ideology bogged me down until I shifted my perspective and began to think of this preconceived "work-life balance" as "work-life mastery" instead.

It's not one or the other. It's both

The breakthrough came when I stopped asking, "How do I separate work and life?" and started pivoting to "How do I make work worth integrating?"

Everyone talks about work-life balance as two polar entities: You have your work life and your home life, and they're completely separate, never to meet. But that belief is where burnout happens.

Instead, learning to blend the two and finding ways to integrate and intersect is where there is real power and personal reward. This doesn't mean you have to work 24/7/365. It means being intentional about what deserves your attention, and when.

Making work meaningful

First and foremost, you should enjoy your work. As entrepreneurs, this is important. You're going to invest many, many hours, especially in the beginning, so rather than begrudge it, embrace it.

Having a strong passion for your business and the services or products you offer will help drive your success: It will help you solve problems and keep your curiosity firing. However, the other benefit is that when you enjoy what you do, the rules for structuring work are thrown out. You'll soon realize you don't have to gate work outside your life but can keep both doors open and accessible at all times.

Finding time for personal time

It should go without saying that you should absolutely schedule personal time, take days off, take vacations, show up for family time. But maybe taking a day off leaves an hour for a board meeting before you go. Maybe weekends also offer a chunk of time to catch up on menial tasks, so they don't waste your attention during the work week.

When I go home every night, I sit down and have dinner with my family. I'll still throw the baseball with my son and make time to coach his baseball team. I'm not working during that time, but that doesn't mean that whole evening or that whole Saturday is completely checked out. It doesn't have to be a full workday, but the purpose is to be flexible with my time and optimize my efficiency.

When I take vacations, I don't completely shut off. I'll still enjoy time away with my family, but I'll check emails while we're getting ready in our hotel and look for updates before going to bed. Doing so helps me stay even tangentially connected and offers a much smoother transition once I'm back to the office because I avoid the burnout of playing catch-up.

Aligning business goals with personal growth

What would shift if you viewed your business as part of your life's purpose rather than something stealing from it? You'd probably have a whole new appreciation for what you do and the value it adds to your life.

If accomplishing business goals doesn't give you a rush of endorphins and a huge sense of personal accomplishment, you may want to reevaluate whether your current line of work is the best fit for you. If your work successes don't also make you want to level up in the gym, at home or in your personal hobbies, then it's time to start finding that inspiration and fusing it into your whole life.

Whereas the old "work-life balance" model assumes work and life compete with each other and that you must escape one to enjoy or focus on the other, it's time to flip the switch and invest in meaningful work that can energize your entire life.
