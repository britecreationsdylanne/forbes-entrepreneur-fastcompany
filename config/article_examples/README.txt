FEW-SHOT ARTICLE EXAMPLES
=========================

Place 2-4 real published articles (or substantial excerpts) for each publication
in the corresponding file. These serve as few-shot examples that Claude will
match in tone, structure, and specificity.

Files:
  forbes_examples.txt        - Real Forbes Business Council articles by Dustin Lemick
  entrepreneur_examples.txt  - Real Entrepreneur Leadership Network articles by Dustin Lemick
  fastcompany_examples.txt   - Real Fast Company Executive Board articles by Dustin Lemick

Format each example like this:

--- EXAMPLE 1 ---
HEADLINE: [The actual published headline]

[The full article text as published, including subheadings]
--- END EXAMPLE 1 ---

--- EXAMPLE 2 ---
HEADLINE: [The actual published headline]

[The full article text as published, including subheadings]
--- END EXAMPLE 2 ---

Key principles:
- Use REAL published text, not descriptions of what you want
- Include specific names, dollar amounts, percentages, and direct quotes
- The more specific and real your examples are, the better the output
- 2-4 examples per publication is the sweet spot
