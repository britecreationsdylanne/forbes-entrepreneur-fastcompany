HEADLINE: How Much Should You Focus On Competitors To Stay Ahead?

Competition is all around us in the business world. It's in the very fabric of the terminology we use, whether we are diving into our competitive advantage or coming up with a new competitive strategy. It's an innocent part of our in-office March Madness brackets and sales team leaderboards. It's why we read professional magazines to glean more business acumen. If you have a business, you always want to be in the know and at the top of your game.

But while a little competition is healthy, emphasis on a little, obsessing over everyone else's place in the market is not. In my experience, it can ultimately make you and your business falter.

There's a very fine line.

There's a nuanced balance to staying up to date on the competition. To use the Goldilocks metaphor, it's important to seek that "just right" element. Your knowledge can't be too little since you need to have some awareness. (Ignorance is not going to be bliss in this scenario.) But it also can't be too much, to the point where you're investing copious amounts of time and resources, or worse yet, to the point where it clouds your judgment and mode of operating.

Competitors should never drive your strategy, unless, of course, there's a massive disruptor who eats up market share with something groundbreaking and you need to pivot to stay viable. But even then, the focus should be on innovating yourself and not becoming a weak copycat. In my experience, doing so ensures a swift ride to the bottom of the chain.

As Steve Jobs once said, "You can't look at the competition and say you're going to do it better. You have to look at the competition and say you're going to do it differently."

Imitation is the best form of flattery.

The flipside, of course, is if your competitor copies you. While this may seem alarming to some, depending on how blatant the replication is, it also isn't an occasion to alter your strategy. If competitors go so far as to pilfer your ideas, it only means you're doing something right and have established yourself as a market leader. You should wear moments like these as a badge of pride and keep doing exactly what you are doing, because it's working.

Take Google, for example. They certainly weren't the first search engine to come online, and they, too, had competition in the beginning, like Yahoo and AskJeeves. As Google started creating a buzz in the market, they trusted in their superior offerings while competitors tried to keep up rather than create their own lane.

We all know what happened: Google became so powerful that it even changed our vernacular. How many times have you told someone to "Google it?" No one is saying "Yahoo it." Even now, as the landscape changes again with AI, Google is working overtime at finding ways to stay ahead and innovate.

Know when it's time to work together.

There are also those occasions when you may want to, or need to, work together with your competition. This may mean teaming up with a newcomer when they bring a revolutionary new idea or product to market that has the potential to overtake your share. Or perhaps they are a legacy company that is rapidly expanding and you don't see a way to step out of their shadow.

Or, worst case scenario, there may be a detrimental development in your industry that threatens the viability of everyone, and you realize you have to fight the situation together. Sometimes, there really is strength in numbers.

Collaboration opportunities shouldn't be rejected just because the invitation is from a competitor. Depending on the terms, a partnership may be a very strategic win for your business. Your rivals are not your enemies; in fact, they can be your secret weapon to achieving greatness. You just have to be precise about when you utilize them.

HEADLINE: Why Growth Isn't Just About Speed; It's About Stability

For years, one of Facebook's guiding principles was "move fast and break things." Mark Zuckerberg coined the concept in 2014, encouraging his software team to innovate as quickly as possible, no matter the outcome.

This idea worked for Facebook and Meta, the company continues to be one of the largest digital entities across the globe. And Zuckerberg is still following that same philosophy, recently shelling out $250 million for one of the top AI developers to ensure the organization is at the forefront of the movement toward automation.

But the truth is that moving fast and breaking things along the way is a risky, costly maneuver that won't pay off for everyone.

Pace yourself.

I would like to offer an alternative to Zuckerberg's ideology for any entrepreneurs looking to effectively scale their business. Remember that fable we were taught as kids: The Tortoise and the Hare? The moral of that story preaches that "slow and steady wins the race." In business speak, it translates to the idea that smaller, progressive wins can get you to your destination, and you probably won't have to fix as much along the way.

The truth is that breaking things and fixing things in real time is hard on employees and your bottom line. Also, if your company is like mine and lives within a regulated industry, anything broken is a recipe for disaster. If you don't have stability, it flows through every part of the business, all the way down to the customer, who is likely to feel that inconsistency. It doesn't look good when everything's breaking, especially when you work in a trust-based business.

Instead, you should weigh necessary growth with a sense of stabilization. While it's important to expand and not remain stagnant, you don't want to lose sight of your principles and fail to stay grounded in your mission.

Find the right balance.

So, how do you balance it all? It's a fine line. If you move too fast and lose stability, it puts a significant stressor on the business and the people on your team. But you also want to keep pushing the organization forward because if you stay comfortable for too long, you can lose your competitive edge. The goal here is to bend but not break.

All of this comes down to process. If you have the right processes in place, if you've invested in or built the right technology, and if you have the right people on your team, you can ignite a lot of growth without creating cracks in the system.

It's also imperative that everyone, from leadership to interns, is on the same page when it comes to pace and the direction you are headed in together. You will never reach your destination on time if you row against each other, but working as a team with a plan keeps you on course.

At BriteCo, our underwriting team is a great example of how we've been able to scale and find growth through the right resources. Our underwriters are under the most pressure because it's the most human-involved part of the business. But we've leveraged technology and automation to try to make that process as efficient as possible.

Always brake for customers.

Arguably, the biggest component of this ongoing sprint is stopping and paying attention to the customers as you continually pick up speed. They are part of your journey and shouldn't be left in the dust. If everyone across your organization is customer-first and customer-centric, this shouldn't be an issue. It's when you start losing focus on your base that things will go awry.

If you're moving fast and customers are happy, keep on going. But if things are breaking due to constant customer issues and you are unable to fix those in your current environment, then you need to pump the brakes and slow down. After all, racing to the finish line won't matter if you have no one supporting you along the way.

HEADLINE: How To Structure Cross-Department Collaboration

We've all heard the sayings "There's strength in numbers" and "There's no 'I' in team" repeatedly. But there's a reason these statements continue to resonate and appear on motivational posters that decorate so many offices: because they're true.

There are few (if any) businesses that have gotten off the ground with just one person. The fact that a business is referred to as a "company" is telling. We need partners, collaborators, investors and workers to help bring life to an idea. But beyond just having people at your side, it is important to build a strong team and ensure they all work well together.

In my experience as a founder and CEO, establishing and encouraging cross-department collaboration is especially important for fast-growing, growth-phase companies when everything is moving fast and many initiatives are launching simultaneously. Key opportunities and important details can get missed if every department is not on the same page and continually communicating and sharing knowledge. With that in mind, here are three valuable lessons I've learned over the years that you can use to create a solid cross-department team culture.

1. Full-team meetings are important.

Consider having "standup" meetings once a week where the entire staff (leadership and upper management included) meet and share updates, both big and small. This creates a regular opportunity for teams to come together to applaud everyone's efforts and learn what everyone is working on, what developments are happening and where they can support each other.

My company amplifies this further with an annual "all hands" gathering, during which different departments share presentations about achievements, new projects and ideas they may want to get off the ground in the near future. I've found that this route can also grow team members' confidence that everyone is moving in the same direction and that their role is critical to the effort.

2. Teams can grow each others' knowledge.

The more knowledge and understanding each employee has about the organization, its current and upcoming projects and its future goals, the more ammunition they have to do their job well. For example, if someone on your marketing team is trying to navigate the intricacies of AI to help them come up with new content ideas, it may be helpful for them to ask the tech team about what they are doing to input AI into the company's processes. This could also lead to conversations with other departments about how best to leverage the growing technology in their own roles. Encouraging this kind of cooperation can help translate team members' best-in-class knowledge across departments.

3. Everyone's role is everyone's business.

One great program we have at my company is "job shadowing": Employees are assigned to watch a colleague while they work and ask them questions so they can gain perspective on the different roles in the organization. Consider having your employees log a certain number of job shadowing hours every year with as many departments as possible. Also, encourage team members to attend any open meetings they see on the calendar if they want to learn more about the related topic or project. I've found that fostering this type of positive, open culture results in everybody talking to each other and keeping lines of communication open, both of which are important for the success of a healthy organization.

4. Keep your door open.

A key part of successfully creating a cross-department collaborative culture is ensuring the management team is invested. This means being open and communicating effectively with team members at all levels of the organization. For example, every time you hire someone new, tell them that you have an open-door policy, and truly mean it. Your team should know they can approach you anytime to ask questions, share ideas or get feedback, and trust that you'll provide open-book responses.

I also recommend ensuring that your onboarding process is very comprehensive so new employees can access all the information they need from day one. Consider scheduling one-on-one meetings with new hires' coworkers in and out of their department, and provide a robust library of educational tools that present a detailed roadmap of your company.

5. See where there's room to improve.

To keep fostering cross-department collaboration, it's equally important that you continually evaluate the strategies and procedures you've put in place and look for areas where there is room for improvement. For example, while we have had a number of these processes in place for years, our company recently decided that we should launch an employee recognition program. The program incentivizes everyone to know the intricacies of their colleagues' roles and to provide acknowledgment when a job is well done. Employees get a monthly balance of "points" that they can give to different coworkers or departments, who can then redeem the points for rewards.

Final Thoughts

When it comes to fostering a collaborative culture, I have found that quality is more important than quantity. Consider starting with something like reducing the number of less-productive single-department meetings in favor of fewer, more imperative group discussions where key players from different departments can be part of the conversation. When everyone is able to work together without the restriction of departmental boundaries, you can create true harmony between your teams.

HEADLINE: Navigating Burnout As A Startup Leader: Lessons From The Trenches

Burnout is a word that every startup founder becomes familiar with at some point due to the long hours, stress and dedication needed at this early stage.

In my time as CEO of an insurance technology company, I have come to understand burnout not as a failure but as a warning that it's time to adjust, reflect and take action.

Learning To Let Go

In the early days of building my company, I admit I wasn't great at managing burnout. The pressure to get everything done was overwhelming, and I felt like I couldn't stop until every last detail was handled. Over time, I've learned that's not sustainable, or necessary.

Managing burnout is also about maintaining perspective and realizing that you won't get everything done. I have learned it's necessary to rely on your team members and co-founders. Sometimes, you'll have to leave things, put them down and end the day without closing all the loops, and that's okay.

A big part of this lesson was learning to prioritize efficiency. Building processes and leveraging technology helped me streamline work and manage tasks more effectively. The more processes you have in place, especially those powered by technology, the more efficiently you can operate.

Creating Space For The Team

As founders, we're not just responsible for our well-being. We must also create an environment where our teams can thrive without burning out. My company encourages employees to take time off and step away when needed. We have an unlimited vacation policy, but everyone still works really hard, and sometimes, we have to encourage them to take a break and refresh.

Celebrating wins is another powerful way to combat burnout. Recognizing achievements, big and small, can help people recharge. It can be a whole team celebration or as simple as taking a moment to be proud of yourself for completing a difficult task.

Additionally, we have implemented practices to make work more manageable and supportive, such as a hybrid work policy. Employees know they can work from home on a day when they just need to focus or have a quieter space. We also have mid-day meditations in the office. These are optional, but the team often takes advantage of them and finds them helpful. With everyone working intensively throughout the day, it helps to have a mindful break where they can unwind.

The Fundraising Grind

If I had to pinpoint the most stressful aspect of running a startup, raising capital would top the list. It's not just the long hours; it's very difficult and draining to face the constant rejection, drawn-out timelines and uncertainty.

During those early days, burnout often felt inevitable. But sometimes, there's no other choice than to push through.

The key to surviving these moments is to put on blinders. The best founders I know are unstoppable. They'll run through brick walls. For me, focusing intently on the most critical tasks and tuning out distractions was the only way to move forward.

Finding Joy In The Work

Burnout isn't just a result of long hours or hard work, it's also about your relationship to the work. I've found that burnout is less likely when you do something you enjoy.

Fundraising burns me out because I don't enjoy it, but building and launching new products energizes me. This isn't unique to startups. If you love what you're doing in any field, there's less likelihood you'll experience burnout. I see it in people who love golfing. They could golf every day and not burn out because of their passion.

It doesn't mean you'll never experience burnout doing what you love, but it's less likely to hit you as hard or as often.

The Hard Lessons

Looking back, I wouldn't say there's a magic formula I wish I'd known earlier. You must experience that to learn and grow as a founder and business leader. There's no shortcut.

However, I strongly recommend all founders and their teams stay consistent with the basics: sleep, healthy eating, and exercise. Founders are notorious for pulling all-nighters and ordering pizza for weeks on end for productivity, but that's the fastest route to burnout. I make it a point to exercise a few times a week and incorporate small routines into my life to support my mental and physical health.

Recognizing And Responding To Burnout

Perhaps the most important lesson I've learned is this: Burnout is normal, but it's not something you can ignore. Just pushing through forever is not a solution. Eventually, you'll hit maximum burnout, and that's the most counterproductive state possible.

Recognizing burnout is the first step to addressing it. Whether it's through rest, reflection, or seeking support, taking deliberate steps to recover is critical.

Burnout As Part Of The Journey

Burnout is a natural part of the entrepreneurial journey, and there's no shame in admitting it. What's important is recognizing the signs, taking action, and creating habits that support long-term well-being, for ourselves and our teams.

By staying aware of our mental and physical states, leaning on our teams, and embracing a healthier approach to work, we can not only survive but thrive, even in the intensity of the startup world.
